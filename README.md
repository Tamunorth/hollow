# hollow_bit

A Flutter assessment project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting project for changera assessment test

### This project was implemented using Riverpod state management and a clean architecture folder structure.

Using MVVM in the presentation layer.
THis contains folders for the screens and corresponding view-models , This may also
contain a widgets directory to store custom widget classes that only exsit on that screen
{This helps to keep code modularized and readable}
This also contains a shared directory that holds custom widgets tht may occur more thatn once in the app
Like a TextButton etc.

The data layer and domin layers are mostly reduntant holding just class definition 
as the assessment did not require connection with external sources of data.

The app layer container utilities and dependencies { For now This only holds  the implementation for the svg Package used in the app}
This was done so that the dependency could be easily changed withhout having to manually chnage all the implementations across the app
This also holds contants that are defined to maintain cleanliness of the code. it also holds the enums folder.

The Generated folder is generated by a plugin on my IDE this auto generates the paths to assests imported into 
the app, these paths are stored in a class called Assets and can be called across the app, 
this is a great time saving tool and reduces the errors relating to inacurrate strings in the app.
